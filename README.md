**Learn Tree Traversal by Building a Binary Search Tree**

A **Binary Search Tree** (BST) is a common data structure where data is sorted hierarchally.

In this project, you'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. You'll also learn key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.
